# Universal coin sorter

Work in progress. This will be a coin sorter similar to [this one](www.thingiverse.com/thing:2189166), which is only for US coins.

Being parametric it will support multiple currencies, as long as you have all the diameters.

### Testing

At the moment you can render [`frame.scad`](frame.scad) to have a hint of how it will look likes. Configured diameters are for Euro coins.
